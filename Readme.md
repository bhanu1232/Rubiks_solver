# 🧠 Rubik's Cube Solver & Visualizer

A complete Rubik's Cube solving application built in Python for the **Aero Hack** assignment. This project features a human-style solving algorithm (CFOP method) and a modern, interactive GUI using `tkinter`.

## 🚀 Overview

This is a comprehensive Rubik’s Cube solver for a standard 3x3 cube. It allows users to scramble the cube, solve it instantly or step-by-step, and visualize the solving process.  
A highlight feature is the ability to export the scramble and solution to [alg.cubing.net](https://alg.cubing.net/) for 3D animated playback.

## ✨ Features

- 🔲 **Interactive 2.5D Cube**  
  Visually accurate cube updates in real-time as you interact or solve.

- 🎲 **Random & Custom Scrambles**  
  Generate random scrambles or enter your own patterns to test the solver.

- 🧩 **Complete CFOP Solver**  
  Fully implements the CFOP method:

  - Cross
  - First Two Layers (F2L)
  - Orientation of Last Layer (OLL)
  - Permutation of Last Layer (PLL)

- 🔍 **Step-by-Step Solution**  
  Walk through each solving stage interactively.

- ⚡ **Instant Full Solve**  
  Solve the cube in a single click.

- 🔗 **Solution Export to 3D**  
  Generates a link to alg.cubing.net with the scramble and solution.

- 💻 **Modern UI**  
  Built with `tkinter.ttk` themed widgets for a clean user experience.
